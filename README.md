# jobs_search

Hackaton for Fudeo Jobs Search Application.

## Description

I have created this app in Flutter, using the following packages:

```yaml
    cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
    dio: ^5.1.1
    provider: ^6.0.5
    shared_preferences: ^2.1.0
    skeletons: ^0.0.3
    intl: ^0.18.1
    url_launcher: ^6.1.10
    flutter_dotenv: ^5.0.2
```

The app consists of two tabs, one for the jobs list with a search bar and the other for a list of favourites.

Tap the `heart` to add a job vacancy to the list of preferred jobs.
